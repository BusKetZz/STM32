## Overview

### What inside

`dependencies` directory collects all the others directories containing files
from `STM32CubeF4` package. The way in which they are organized may differ from
that in `STM32CubeF4` package.


### Directories and files hierarchy

* `cmsis`: contains all the source and header files related to specific CPU
    architecture (e.g. Cortex-M4) and specific MCU model (e.g. STM32F407xx).

* `drivers`: contains all the source and header files related to specific type
    of peripheral drivers (e.g. low-layer drivers or HAL drivers).

* `linker_scripts`: contains files (usually single file) related to linker
    activity, i.e. linking all the object files generated by the compiler and
    match them with appropriate addresses in accordance with given CPU
    architecture and MCU model.
