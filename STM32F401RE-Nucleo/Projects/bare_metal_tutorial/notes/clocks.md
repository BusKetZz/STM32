## Clock sources used to drive the system clock (SYSCLK)
* HSI (High Speed Internal) oscillator clock.
* HSE (High Speed External) oscillator clock.
* Main PLL (Phase Locked Loop) clock.

## Secondary clock sources
* 32 [kHz] LSI RC (Low Speed Internal RC).
* 32.768 [kHz] LSE crystal (Low Speed External).
